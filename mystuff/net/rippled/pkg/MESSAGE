found rippled.cfg and validators.txt in /etc/rippled
you need to check /usr/share/examples/rippled/
there might be some changes in the cfg files

WATCH FOR IT
i have changed the default data directory from /var/lib/rippled to /var/run/rippled
seems like littering a system to create /var/lib on a system where it is not there.
