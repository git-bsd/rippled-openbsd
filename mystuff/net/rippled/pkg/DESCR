This is my first port
For any tips, tricks, please take up contact with me

Rippled is a blockchain daemon that powers the XRP ledger
There is 2 flavors included in this port, regular or p2p mode
And reporting mode https://xrpl.org/build-run-rippled-in-reporting-mode.html
I'm working on generating some more packaged docs/manpages
For now i suggest you look on xrpl.org for reference.
